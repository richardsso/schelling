# Schelling Segregation
The Schelling Segregation model is a very simple model to demonstrate the effect of preferences on segregation. It was conceived by the economist Thomas C. Schelling in 1969, who went on to receive the Nobel Price in economics for his work in 2005.

In this model we assume a discrete 2-dimensional world on a regular NxN cell grid. In this world a given number of agents are randomly placed on cells. Each agent has a color of Red, Green or Blue. It is assigned randomly at the start of the model and will stay the same throughout the whole simulation. Each cell can only hold a single agent and is thus either occupied by an agent or empty. For example if the worlds dimensions are 20x20 then we might place 250 random agents on the 400 available cells, 150 will be left empty.
